# Baby Due Date Calculator

This is a simple, mobile-friendly web application for calculating a baby's estimated due date (EDD) based on the user's last menstrual period (LMP) and typical cycle length. The website is static and designed to be easily hostable on GitHub Pages.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file that contains all the styles for the application.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the application, including the EDD calculation.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy this application to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  Push the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to the repository.
3.  Go to the "Settings" tab of the repository.
4.  In the "Pages" section, select the `main` branch as the source and click "Save".
5.  The application will be deployed to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

## Future Extensibility

The application has been designed to be easily extensible. Here are some potential future features that could be added:

*   **Email/text notifications:** The application could be integrated with a third-party service to send email or text notifications to the user with their EDD.
*   **User login:** A user login system could be added to allow users to save their EDD and receive daily updates.
*   **Mobile app conversion:** The application could be converted to a mobile app using a framework like React Native or Flutter. The modular JavaScript code should make this process relatively straightforward.
